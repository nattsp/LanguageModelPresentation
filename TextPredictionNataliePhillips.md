Text Prediction for improved speed and consistency
========================================================

I have put together a proof of concept text prediction algorithm.
If we incorporate this into our corporate communication tools we can improve the speed and consistecy in the creation of communication messages.

The models model is live and can be found 
<https://nattsapps.shinyapps.io/ShinyTextPrediction/>.

I believe using our own in-house language model such as this text prediction algorithm we will be able to incorporate our standard industry specific terms and language style we would like all our employees use when communicating with our customers.

Communication with clients is a large part of our brand. Displaying the right word at the right time will give us a cohesive and consistent appearenace to our clients. It will also cut the time it takes for new employees to come up to speed with our way of doing business.

Language model
========================================================

This model is built using the Stupid Backoff method due to its superior speed and reasonable performance
